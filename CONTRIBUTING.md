Contributing to Karmen
=======

Every help is appreciated, but please make sure to read through the items below
to make the process a little bit easier for everybody.

In general, all of our communication happens here on [GitHub](https://github.com/fragaria/karmen)
or on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/fragaria/karmen). We might respond on some other channel, but
these two are recommended.

Before contributing, make sure that you are comfortable with the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public License, version 3](./LICENSE.txt).

## Reporting bugs, asking for features, improving documentation

Just file an issue [here](https://github.com/fragaria/karmen/issues/new) with a description
of your problem. If you are reporting a bug, tell us as many information as possible
(e. g. on which platform you are running the software, the steps to reproduce, screenshots...).

## Contributing with code

Just send us a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
We are not really enforcing any rules, code coverage and stuff like that, but please, be reasonable
and make sure that the build with your changes is passing on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/fragaria/karmen).

We reserve the right to not accept your Pull Request, but we will always try to explain our reasoning.

**Thank you for any kind of contribution!**
