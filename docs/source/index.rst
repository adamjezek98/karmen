Karmen - monitor and manage your 3D printers
############################################

**Karmen** aims to give its users a single place for monitoring
and managing multiple 3D printers. While existing solutions
such as `Octoprint <https://octoprint.org>`_ excel in controlling
a single printer, there does not seem to be an open source platform
for a multi-printer setup or even a large scale printer farm.

Our solution is a perfect fit for a shared makerspace, small batch
part factory or a public school that offers multiple printers to various
users. We are targeting two main use-cases: monitoring and print management.

This project is developed `as free and open source software <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software>`_
mainly by the people of `Fragaria <https://fragaria.cz>`_ but all contributions
are more than welcome, so join us on `GitHub <https://github.com/fragaria/karmen>`_.
